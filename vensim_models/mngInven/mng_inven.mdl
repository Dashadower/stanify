		current inventory permits under normal circumstances.  Low inventory \
		availability reduces shipments below customer orders.  Unfilled customer \
		orders are lost.

		fall below orders.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \

		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.
