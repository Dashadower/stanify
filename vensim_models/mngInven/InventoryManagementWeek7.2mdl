	~	Dimensionless
	~	The Fraction of customer orders filled is determined by the ratio of the \

	~	Safety stock coverage is the number of weeks of the expected order rate \

		possibility that unforeseen variations in demand will cause shipments to \
		fall below orders.
	|

Shipment Rate=
	Desired Shipment Rate*Order Fulfillment Ratio
	~	Widgets/Week
	~	The shipment rate is the desired shipment rate multiplied by the fraction \
		of orders filled (the order fulfillment ratio.   Shipments fall below \
		desired shipments when the feasible shipment rate falls below the desired \
		rate, indicating that some products are unavailable.
